            "source": "# Preparing Labeled Training Documents\nIn this section we will further transform the document vectors into some form that NLTK can take to train a\nclassifier. Generally speaking, a classification algorithm needs to take in a set of training documents, each\nassociated with its correct label, in order to train a classifier. In NLTK, such labeled training data needs to\nbe represented as a list in which each element is a tuple having two elements. Tuple is a data structure in\nPython. Each tuple contains a number of elements, usually of different types. Tuples are represented using\nround brackets. For example, (\u2019A\u2019, 1) is a tuple with two elements, a string and a number. ([1, 3,\n6], \u2019ABC\u2019) is also a tuple with two elements, a list and a string. In NLTK, to represent a labeled training\ndocument, we use a tuple that consists of a dict type of object together with a label.\n\nFor example, the following tuple represents a labeled training document:\n\n(f\u2019police\u2019:1 \u2019lawyer\u2019:1, \u2019court\u2019:1g, \u2019Crime\u2019)\n\nHere the second element of this tuple is the string \u2019Crime\u2019, which is the label of this training document.\nThe first element of the tuple is a dict object f\u2019police\u2019:1 \u2019lawyer\u2019:1, \u2019court\u2019:1g. What\nthis dict object means is that the value of the feature \u2019police\u2019 is 1, the value of the feature \u2019lawyer\u2019\nis 1, and the value of the feature \u2019court\u2019 is also 1.\n\nA training set to be used by NLTK is a list of such tuples. For example, the following list is a training\ndata set that can be passed to a classification algorithm in NLTK:\n\n[(f\u2019police\u2019:1 \u2019lawyer\u2019:1, \u2019court\u2019:1g, \u2019Crime\u2019), (f\u2019coach\u2019:1 \u2019game\u2019:1g,\n\u2019Sports\u2019)]\n\nThis training data set consists of two training documents, one labeled as Crime and the other labeled as\nSports.\n\nNote that the features do not have to be strings. If we have mapped the word police to 1, the word lawyer\nto 2, and so on, then the training set above can also be represented as follows:\n\n[(f1:1 2:1, 3:1g, \u2019Crime\u2019), (f4:1 5:1g, \u2019Sports\u2019)]\n\nOur goal now is to create such kind of a list. We need to take out each vector from all tf vectors,\nconvert it to a dict object, associate it with a label, and add it to the final list of training data.",
